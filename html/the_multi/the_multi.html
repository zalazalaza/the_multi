<h2>Where to start?</h2>
<p>The multi is the game I have always wanted to play, which is why I am making it. Its intent is to blur worldviews and increase the creativity of its players in very simple way. Its most basic foundation is the trans dimensionalism contained within the supernatural worldview of David Icke.  It is not meant to elevate or ridicule the people that have adopted this worldview or the ideas themselves. Rather, it is meant to be an enjoyable framework and catalyst for inspecting the nature of reality and the interaction of the infitite mythologies available to us.</p>
