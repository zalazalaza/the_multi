<h1>I just dont know</h1>
<p>Intergallactic superheroes, stuck in the farthest reaches of the galaxy isolated from all other lifeforms they have devised other means of communication off planet.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of their extreme distance from all other life in the galaxy they have a special interest in the continued success and survival of life on other planets.  Sharing a likeness with us humans on Earth implies a possible shared history they consider themselves distant guardians of the Earthlings.  They can only manifest in spirit form on Earth though, which leaves them incapable and non existent to most.</p>
<h2>RULE</h2>
<p>Disembodied - Pleiadians do not physically exist in any dimension on Earth can cannot use their body stat.  When necessary a PLeiadians __true_love__ can volunteer to embody them on planet.</p>
<h2>RULE</h2>
<p>True love - Any interaction a pleiadian has in any Earthly dimension is attached to a __living_human__. All communication must be routed through this person with which a deep emotional bond is formed.</p>
<h2>RULE</h2>
<p>Unreal - Pleiadians get plus 10 to all 3 stats.</p>
